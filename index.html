  <p>I am a fully qualified <span class="purple">Clinical Sports and Remedial Massage Therapist</span> and <span class="purple">Reflexologist</span>, achieving my Level 5 BTEC in 2015 at the London School of Sports and Remedial Massage. Currently practicing near <span class="purple">Bury St Edmunds</span>, I start off with a postural assessment, and then use my extensive knowledge and expertise, to create a <span class="purple">personal treatment plan</span> for each and every client. Here are just some of the known <span class="purple">benefits</span> of soft tissue therapy:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ease Neck, Shoulder & Back Pain</li>
      <li class="purple">Relieve the Symptoms of Stress</li>
      <li>Promote Recovery After Injury</li>
      <li class="purple">Loosen Stiff & Tight Muscles</li>
      <li>Improve Flexibility & Mobility</li>
      <li class="purple">Reduce Risk of Injury</li>
      <li>Aid Relaxation</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Do you have a <span class="purple">chronic condition</span> or <span class="purple">disability</span>? Are you concerned about receiving a massage? I am experienced in supporting people with many conditions such as <span class="purple">fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, ankylosing spondylitis</span> and <span class="purple">arthritis</span>, and I can even get great results when massaging through clothes if this makes my clients feel more comfortable. </p>
